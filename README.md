# Space Defender - Python Tutor Assessment

This game has been created as an assessment tool for Python tutors. It demonstrates the use of PgZero, math, and random modules to create a fully functional game.

## Game Objective
Control a spaceship to avoid asteroids while shooting enemy ships. Score points by destroying enemies, and try to survive as long as possible!

## Controls
- Arrow keys: Move the player's ship
- Space: Fire laser

## Assessment Criteria
This code demonstrates:
1. Python fundamentals (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
2. Object-oriented programming concepts
3. Game development principles (collision detection, sprite management)
4. Clean code organization and commenting
5. Implementation using restricted modules (PgZero, math, random, Rect)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PgZero (Pygame Zero)

## Running the Game
