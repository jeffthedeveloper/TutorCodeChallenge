# Dungeon Explorer - Python Tutor Assessment

This game has been created as an assessment tool for Python tutors. It demonstrates the use of PgZero, math, and random modules to create a fully functional Rogue-like game.

## Game Objective
Control your hero through a dungeon, collecting treasures while avoiding enemies. Progress through levels by collecting all treasures on each level.

## Controls
- Arrow keys: Move the player's character
- Mouse: Navigate the menu
- Enter: Start game or restart after game over

## Features
- Main menu with "Start Game", "Sound On/Off", and "Exit" buttons
- Background music and sound effects with toggle option
- Multiple dangerous enemies that move within their defined areas
- Classes for character movement and sprite animation
- Sprite animation for both movement and idle states of the hero and enemies
- Score tracking and high score saving
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty

## Assessment Criteria
This code demonstrates:
1. Python fundamentals (variables, functions, loops, conditionals)
2. Object-oriented programming concepts (classes, inheritance)
3. Game development principles (collision detection, sprite management, animation)
4. Clean code organization and commenting
5. Implementation using restricted modules (PgZero, math, random, Rect from Pygame)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PgZero (Pygame Zero)

## Running the Game
```
python dungeon_explorer.py
```
